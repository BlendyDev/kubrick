TODO LIST - as at 25 March 2008
-------------------------------

Fixing Bugs and Blemishes

- Revive the text-labels that appear in cube views (disappeared in Qt 4.4).
- Revive the alternate keyboard shortcuts (disappeared since KDE 4.0 release).
- Implement the three-item View menu as described in the Kubrick Handbook.
- Keep the feedback on the status bar up to date.
- Set the toolbar default to be IconsOnly.  Add text, tooltips and whatsthis.
- Make the implementation of Settings more consistent between demos and play.
- Streamline the way the mouse works in left-button slice-moves.
- Smooth out or avoid sudden jumps during right-button cube-rotation.
- Avoid ugly use of rapid animation for own moves when re-playing several moves.
- Improve the look of the lighting and specular reflections.

Adding New Features

- Implement "Go To Standard View" from an arbitrary rotation of the whole cube.
- Integrate keyboard moves and move-memory with rotations of the whole cube.
- Implement Singmaster's move notation for keyboard moves (e.g. LRUDFB for
  Left, Right, Up, Down, Front and Back), probably in a text-entry box, to
  allow for combined strings of moves to be entered and executed.
- Implement anti-aliasing, but with minimal performance loss (prob. KDE 4.2).
