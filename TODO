TODO LIST - as at 11 April 2008
-------------------------------

Fixing Bugs and Blemishes

- Icons needed for Kubrick application and the three new View actions.
- Alternate keyboard shortcuts disappeared since KDE 4.0 release. Revive them.
- Implementation of Settings to be made more consistent between demos and play.
- Toolbar default should be set to IconsOnly.
- Streamlined left-button slice-move sometimes goes in an unexpected direction.
- Sudden jumps during right-button cube-rotation - smooth out or avoid.
- Blinking on keyboard moves is not quite right. Seems to start too soon and
  flicker before it starts.

Adding New Features

- Implement "Go To Standard View" from an arbitrary rotation of the whole cube.
- Integrate keyboard moves and move-memory with rotations of the whole cube.
- Implement Singmaster's move notation for keyboard moves (e.g. LRUDFB for
  Left, Right, Up, Down, Front and Back), probably in a text-entry box, to
  allow for combined strings of moves to be entered and executed.
- Implement anti-aliasing, but with minimal performance loss (prob. KDE 4.2).
- Remove the status-bar. Put all in-game messages into the OpenGl canvas.
- Add a move-counter.
- Do something special when the cube has been solved.
