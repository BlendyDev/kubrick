    <p>
      Kubrick is a game based on the Rubik's Cubeâ„¢ puzzle. The cube sizes range
      from 2x2x2 up to 6x6x6, or you can play with irregular "bricks" such as 5x3x2
      or "mats" such as 6x4x1 or 2x2x1. The game has a selection of puzzles at
      several levels of difficulty, as well as demos of pretty patterns and
      solution moves, or you can make up your own puzzles.
